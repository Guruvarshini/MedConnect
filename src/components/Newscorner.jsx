<Card head="A team of doctors at Apollo Hospitals, Ahmedabad has successfully performed liver transplant on a7-month-old baby, the first liver transplant of infant in Gujarat." image="https://cdn.apollohospitals.com/dev-apollohospitals/2023/10/liverTransplant_infant.jpg" content="An experienced team of healthcare experts were involved in the transplant including Prof. Darius Mirza, a stalwart with experience, having led the Birmingham team in performing over 6,000 liver transplants across the globe. Prof. Mirza, The Lead Liver Transplant Surgeon, Western region, Apollo Hospitals Group, joined Dr. Chirag Desai, Senior Liver Transplant Surgeon, Dr. Pathik Parikh, Liver Transplant Physician, Dr. Pushkar Srivastava, Dr Shailesh Sable (Transplant Surgeon), Dr Rohan Chaudhary (Transplant Surgeon), Head of Department- Pediatric intensivist and Neonatologist, along with a large, experienced team of specialists to offer the best quality care in the management of liver diseases and transplant in Gujarat.

The patient was a male child from Beyt Dwarka, Gujarat. The child’s medical challenges began with the onset of jaundice within a few weeks of his birth. Unfortunately, the condition progressed rapidly, leading to irreversible liver damage due to a genetic disease known as Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC).

Dr. Pathik Parikh (Senior Liver Transplant Physician), at Apollo Hospitals Ahmedabad, said, “When we diagnosed the child with PFIC, we knew there was no alternative but to perform a liver transplant to prevent further damage to other vital organs. The child’s parents, who are also young adults, consented to the procedure on being explained the seriousness of their child’s condition.”

Since the chance of getting a liver for such a young child is very low, the mother donated a portion of her liver for the transplant. The team at Apollo Hospitals, Ahmedabad faced several challenges before, during and after the surgery due to the complex nature of the surgery. One of the biggest challenges was the child’s extremely small body. Meticulous surgical planning was required to ensure the child was nutritionally optimized to tolerate the 8–10-hour surgery." link=""/>

With 90% success rates, The Apollo Liver Transplant program is a beacon of quality and hope for patients from across the world.

Noted Film Actress Ms Dimple Kapadia, who graced the function said, “In Dil Chahta Hai, my character Tara Jaiswal died because of a silent killer, Liver Cirrhosis. As we go about our daily lives, we often neglect the importance of our liver, this unsung hero of our bodies. Our liver is a remarkable organ, tirelessly working to cleanse your blood, store energy, and produce essential proteins. It is the silent guardian that protects us from harmful toxins and keeps us healthy. But just like any other organ, it can be damaged, and when it is, the consequences can be devastating. Liver transplantation is a lifesaving therapy saving lives every day. Liver Transplantation has given a new lease of life to Sanjay, the first child in India to receive a liver transplant, Prisha the 500th child transplanted at Apollo and hundreds of children and adults not just from India but from 50 countries across the world. I would like to congratulate the Apollo Team and wish them the very best in their commitment to save lives”." link=""/>
<Card head="On the occasion of National Cancer Awareness Day, Apollo Proton Cancer Centre has launched Centre of Excellence for Head and Neck Cancer." image="https://cdn.apollohospitals.com/dev-apollohospitals/2023/11/Head_and_Neck.jpg" content="Apollo Proton Cancer Centre (APCC) has inaugurated its groundbreaking Centre of Excellence (CoE) for Head and Neck Cancer. With a comprehensive approach to cancer management and cutting-edge technologies, APCC is set to revolutionize the way head and neck cancer is treated, offering patients the best possible oncological outcomes while preserving their functionality and cosmesis.

Head and Neck cancer is a significant public health concern, with 57.5% of cases worldwide occurring in Asia. India bears a heavy burden, accounting for 30% of all head and neck cancers globally. In 2018, India recorded 1,19,992 new cases and 72,616 deaths due to oral cancers, earning the country the unfortunate title of being the “capital of oral cancers.” This alarming trend is often attributed to unique habits, such as tobacco chewing, and the high incidence of oral cancer associated with smokeless tobacco use.

Dr. Sapna Nangia, Director – Breast, Head & Neck, Department of Radiation Oncology, APCC, emphasized the gravity of the situation, saying, “The prevalence of head and neck cancer in India is a cause for concern, and it necessitates a specialized and integrated approach to treatment. APCC’s Centre of Excellence for Head and Neck Cancer is committed to providing the best possible oncological outcomes while prioritizing functional and cosmetic outcomes for our patients.”" link=""/>
